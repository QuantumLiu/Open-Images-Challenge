Folder for experimental files. There are many bugs I had to find and fix.

1. Changed unit8 to unit16 for 500 classes
2. Changed the x and y axes for submission format
3. Changed the inference code to be faster. Now takes about 0.75 s/image.
4. Changed code to output classes names according to code names required for competition.
5. Changed code to process images into rgb arrays instead of bgr arrays.
6. Added code for tracking progress.
7. Tried many other models, but did not perform well enough.
