# Open-Images-Challenge
Object detection challenge on open images dataset

I used the Faster RCNN pretrained model to do object detection. I wrote code based on the object detection tutorial given with Tensorflow's Object Detection API.

This requires Tensorflow's Object Detection API to run. It scores 0.36121 public score and 0.33093 private score on kaggle evaluation server.

Run frcnn1.py to run inference on 99999 images in the OID challenge2018 set.

Misc files are just files I used for experiments.
